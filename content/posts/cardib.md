Belcalis Marlenis Almánzar (born October 11, 1992), known professionally as Cardi B, is an American rapper and actress.[2] Born and raised in New York City, she became an Internet celebrity by achieving popularity on Vine and Instagram.[3] From 2015 to 2017, she appeared as a regular cast member on the VH1 reality television series Love & Hip Hop: New York, which depicted her pursuit of her music aspirations. She released two mixtapes—Gangsta Bitch Music, Vol. 1 (2016) and Vol. 2 (2017), before signing with Atlantic Records in February 2017.

Her debut studio album, Invasion of Privacy (2018), debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, broke several streaming records, was certified triple platinum by the RIAA and named by Billboard the top female rap album of the 2010s.[4] Critically acclaimed, it won the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album, making Cardi B the only woman to win the award as a solo artist, as well as the first female rap artist in 15 years to be nominated for Album of the Year. It spawned two number-one singles on the Billboard Hot 100; "Bodak Yellow", which made her the only female rapper to achieve a Diamond-certified song by the RIAA, and the second female rapper to top the chart with a solo output following Lauryn Hill in 1998, and "I Like It", which made her the first female rapper to attain multiple number-one songs on the chart. Her 2018 collaboration with pop rock band Maroon 5, "Girls Like You" made her the only female rapper to top the Hot 100 three times. "WAP" (featuring Megan Thee Stallion), the lead single of her second album, made her the only female rap artist to achieve Billboard Hot 100 chart-topping singles in two decades (2010s and 2020s). "Up", the following single, made her the only female rapper to achieve multiple Hot 100 number ones with solo songs, and extended her record as the female rapper with the most Hot 100 number-one singles as her fifth leader.
